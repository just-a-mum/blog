I was sitting in a library and preparing for the exam. It was quiet, but I couldn't concentrate. Then I noticed a girl sitting opposite me and playing with a piece of paper. At first, I didn't pay much attention to what she was doing, but then I saw her holding a small swan in her hands folded from the paper. I was fascinated by this and decided to start a conversation.

The girl told me that she is looking for some simple crafty ideas for a kids' party and practicing her origami skills. She showed me an origami book with simple folding instructions and a few figures she already made. It looked fun and the next hour I spent building various animals out of the pieces of paper.

Since that day I always loved to play with paper but never had time for bigger projects.

After I had my first baby I started spending much more time at home and this allowed me to experiment more with paper. At first, I started with origami, but now I switched to the card making and quilling. You can find some of my work here.
