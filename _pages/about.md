<p>It was a dark, cold and rainy evening. The perfect weather to stay at home and play some quiet games with kids or read books.
I was sitting on the sofa with my two baby boys.
We were trying to put pieces of the puzzle together. To be honest, they were playing happily by themselves. I was just sitting next to them and thinking about life.
This was one of the moments when no one is screaming and I can relax and enjoy the time.</p>
<p>Since my first baby was born my life changed completely. I used to be a software developer and now my normal day is spinning around kids and the house.
Every day is a new challenge and it's far from the family life that is advertised by the media.
It's much harder than I expected and I wasn't fully prepared. Sometimes I'm so exhausted that I don't have any energy even to do basic house chores.</p>

<p>How do other people manage their work and family life? There are so many mums around and every one of them goes through this. </p>

<p>That evening I decided to start a blog where I can share the challenges of motherhood and how I solve them.</p>
