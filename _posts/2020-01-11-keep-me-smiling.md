I've been through the time when my baby was crying all the time and I couldn't understand why. It started from the first day I came back from the hospital. It is very frustrating not to know what is going on and how to help your baby.

With time I created a checklist of actions that helped me to find out the reason why my baby is possibly crying.

##### Check the nappy<br />
It is that simple. Check if the nappy should be changed. Poop can irritate soft baby skin or your baby might not like wearing wet nappy.

Make sure that the skin under the nappy is not red. Nappy rash can be one of the reasons why your baby is unsettled and it can be fixed with sudo cream.

##### Feed him<br />
Babies eat often and a lot. They cry to indicate that it's a time to eat. Sometimes your little one can get hungry very quickly even if you fed him not that long time ago. Try to feed him to see if this helps and quite often it solves the problem.

Don't forget to burp your little one after feeding to avoid trapped air that can cause pain.

##### Undress or Dress up your baby<br />
To my surprise it's can be hard to understand when the baby feels too hot or too cold. Undress the baby if it is very hot or put an extra layer of cloth if it's not warm enough. Usually, the rule is simple: your baby should wear one extra layer than you.
In my case putting on an extra layer on my baby was solving the problem with crying and he could sleep peacefully.

Some babies like swaddling. You can try using swaddling cloth to make your little one feel more comfortable.

##### Give a hug or it's a bed time<br />
Babies love to be very close to the mum and they tend to get tired very quickly. Usually, babies have a sleeping routine and if your little one cries just a little bit before the sleep time, then it's a signal that it's the time to go to bed. Sometimes just holding the baby helps to prevent crying.

##### Check if there is some pain<br />
There are several symptoms that the baby is in pain. The main signal that something is wrong is when the baby is crying more intense than usual. As a mum, you can always recognize this type of crying.

Try checking if there is any redness on the skin (under the nappy, neck, under the arms) and use sudo cream if needed.

The other very common reason is colic. It happens very often with babies under 6 months. Burp your little one after every feed. Also, you can try doing baby massage. If this happens very often you can buy anti-colic medicine for babies in the pharmacy

Usually one of the actions above helps with crying. However, if your baby cries all the time and nothing helps then go to see your GP. They will check what is upsetting your baby.

I hope that your baby smiles most of the time and is crying only to show that it is the food time.
