When you are just starting making cards or doing scrapbooking you don't need many tools. However, once you realized that this is something you love doing you can try more techniques, buy more tools and experiment even more.

I provided below the list of items that you might need for your card making or scrapbooking projects.

##### 1. Cardstock Paper

Paper is essential and must have for card making or scrapbooking. You would need the paper of various colors and thicknesses. You can also experiment with different finishes or try to use cardboard. For the cardbase, I would suggest using 300 gsm paper and for the layering 160 - 220 gsm. There is another post that covers deferent types of paper.

###### 2. Cutting mat

It is important to have a cutting mat to protect your surface from the damage when you use a craft knife. It also makes it easier to work on your project as it has a measurement grid on the top of it.

##### 3. Craft knife and paper trimmer

You would need something to cut your paper. Paper trimmers make cuts very precisely, allow you to have consistent measurements and straight lines without much effort.
Craft knives are useful to cut small pieces of paper. I love working with craft knives and use them all the time.

##### 4. Scissors

I find it hard to work with the paper without scissors. You would need it to cut out shapes that are not just a straight line. It is very useful if you want to cut a stamped object or just to make a flower.

##### 5. Glue

You won't be able to complete any of your projects without glue or tape as you need to attach objects to your cards. There are several types of glues that I covered in another post, but my preferred ones are tacky glue, glue pen and double-sided tape.

##### 6. Clear stamps

If you are a fan of stamping then there are a lot of different stamps available on the market. For the cardmaking or scrapbooking, you would need clear stamps for sentiments or other fun objects especially if you are not good at drawing by hand. They are fairly cheap and easy to use.

##### 7. Stamping folder and stamping blocks

If you are considering to use clear stamps then this one is a must have. Some people find it comfortable just using stamping blocks, but I prefer to use a stamping folder. The advantage of the stamping folder is that it holds the paper in the one place and you can reapply the ink as much as you want. I use it all the time for all sorts of stamping.

##### 8. Ink

You need ink for stamping. There is another post that covers different ink types. I fall in love with Versafine ink as it gives a very clear and crisp image.

##### 9. Markers, pencils, crayons, paint

These are the fun tools to experiment with. You can use them with stencils to make an unusual patterns, draw something by hand or just use it to add the final touch to the project. The only limitation is your creativity and imagination.

##### 10. Die cutting machine

Die cutting machine gives opportunities to easily cut out complex and unusual designs of the paper. There are a lot of different machines in various price ranges. They can be electric or manual.  Some of them can even do embossing using embossing folders. There is no need to go for the expensive ones, but pay attention to the size of dies it can work with and if it is suitable for paper embossing.

##### 11. Dies

There is a large variety of cutting dies with different shapes. Consider getting some universal ones that you can use for different projects and later on you can buy more.

##### 12. Embossing folders

If you have a die cutting machine that can be used with embossing folders then you are in luck. Just run the folder through your die cutting machine and your paper will turn into art itself and will stand out. You can also add some color to the pattern on the paper using your ink pads.

##### 13. Scoring board

Did you ever try to fold your paper without any tools? Apparently, it's not that straight forward if you want to avoid wrinkles. To have a perfect fold you need to have a bone folder and scoring board.
If you don't want to get one you can also buy pre-scored cards.

##### 14.Embossing powder

One of the ways of doing embossing is to use embossing powder with a heating tool. It gives a wow effect to your cards. I like it more than embossing with the machine but takes a little bit more time to do it.

##### 15. Heating tools

You needed it if you want to do embossing with powder. It is also used to dry the background colors on the paper or ink stamps. It saves a lot of time as you don't need to wait for hours for your project to dry.
If you are thinking about using the hairdryer, then I would have to disappoint you. It blows too much and doesn't become hot enough for it to be used as a heating tool for embossing.

##### 17. Embellishments

These are nice to have to add the final touch to your projects, though you can live without it. I love using crystals, ribbons and pearl drops


The most important thing is to let your creativity and imagination to build amazing projects. Don't be scared to experiment and make sure that you have a lot of fun.
