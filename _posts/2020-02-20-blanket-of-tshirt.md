There are times when you end up with a lot of old cloth that you don't need anymore, but cannot throw it away for various reasons. I always have a lot of old t-shirts left that are not suitable for charities and just the idea of throwing them away makes me feel sad.

To my surprise, there are a lot of things you can do out of the t-shirts. A blanket is one of them. It's fun to make it, but a time-consuming process that also requires some skills. On the other hand, it will help you to convert all your valuable t-shirts into something useful.

Did you know that there are even companies that can do it for you?

##### Things you need
- scissors or rotary cutter
- iron
- sewing machine
- threads
- material for backing
- batting if you want your blanket to be warm
- fusible interfacing to stop you t-shirts from stretching
- at least 6 t-shirts for a baby blanket or 12 t-shirts for the big blanket

##### Process

1. Cut squares or rectangles from the front side of each t-shirt
2. Take fusible interfacing and iron it at the back of each t-shirt piece
3. Lay down all the t-shirt pieces to make the desired pattern
4. Stitch all your pieces together making sure that all seams are open
5. Iron all your seams flat
6. Take your backing and cut out a piece that is slightly bigger than the top
7. Cut the batting of the size of the t-shirts pattern that you just stitched together
8. Layer backing, batting, t-shirts top layer and stitch them all together along the seams in the t-shirts top part
9. Make some binding to stitch it to the edge of the blanket
10. It's all done and at this stage you can also decorate your blanket

I hope your blanket turned out as you expected and will last you for a long time.
