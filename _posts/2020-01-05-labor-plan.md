Are you already at the end of your third trimester? This is a very exciting time as you will meet your baby very soon for the first time.  You never know when your little one decides to arrive and sometimes it happens earlier than you expect. It's better to be prepared in advance to avoid frustration.

When I was waiting for my first baby I didn't know what to expect and this was stressing me out a lot. I was wondering what should be my action plan once my labour starts, how will I know that it's the time to go to the hospital and what should I take with me. I put together a list of actions I had to do to prepare for my big day.

1. **Decide where you want to give birth and find where the place is located**<br/>
If you have a chance to visit the place where you are considering to give birth do it. It can take some time to find your way to the right place and this is the last thing you want to worry about when you have contractions. It's better to be familiar with the place where you would need to go once the labour starts.

2. **Write down the phone number of your birth center**<br />
To be honest it is one of the most important phone numbers and it always should be around. You would need to call it when your labour starts or if your waters break or if you just worry about anything pregnancy related. Nurses are always there to help you.

3. **Decide how to get to the birth center or hospital**<br />
There are several ways you can get to the hospital or the birth center:
- **Your car**<br/>
That's good if you have a car and your partner is happy to drive to the hospital. In this case, you just need to find out where to drop the car while you are in the hospital. Don't forget to buy a car seat for your newborn.<br />
We didn't have a car and we had to look into the other options.<br/><br/>
- **Public transport.**<br/>
It is possible to get to the hospital by public transport, but if your labour starts in the night or your contractions are too strong then it might be hard to do that and it is better to look into other options.<br/><br/>
- **Taxi**<br/>
I would say this is the least stressful option if you don't own a car. Find out in advance the phone numbers of taxi companies around you and find out how long it takes them to arrive to you. You wouldn't want to look for a car when you have contractions as it can be quite stressful. I didn't check this in advance and we couldn't find a taxi when my labour started. That was very frustrating.<br/><br/>
- **Friends with a car**<br/>
Find some friends with a car who would be happy to drive to the hospital even in the middle of the night. You can use this option as a backup plan in case there won't be any taxis available.

4. **Decide which pain relief to use and if you want one.** <br/>
Usually, labour doesn't happen according to the plan and I didn't follow any of my birth plans. Though you still need to know if you want to use any pain relief. These days hospitals provide a few options including an epidural. I had one of the labours with epidural and another one without. I never thought that I would say that, but think twice before going for it.
Epidural generally is an amazing option as you don't feel anything and just enjoying your labour, BUT the biggest downside of this is that you don't feel anything during the pushing stage ether and this can lead to bigger tears and longer recovery. It's usually better to have control over the process.

5. **Prepare your partner**<br/>
Tell your partner how he can help you during your labour and show him what exactly he needs to do. I wish I thought about this in advance. My partner didn't know how he could help me and was just watching me.

6. **Hospital bag** <br/>
Make sure you packed your hospital bag a few weeks before your expected date. If you leave it until the last moment there is a chance that you will forget something. Believe me, it is had to concentrate when you have contractions. I created in the other post a list of things that should be in your hospital bag.

7. **Plan your return**<br />
If you drive and you have a baby chair in your car, then you are sorted and it would be an easy journey home with your little one. If you are considering to go home by taxi then make sure that the taxi driver has the correct baby chair in the car. It can be surprisingly hard to find a taxi that is fully equipped and happy to drive a newborn from the hospital. If you live close enough and considering to go home by public transport then you don't need to have anything baby specific with you apart from the sling.

8. **Relax and stay calm**<br/>
Trust nature and try to relax. Nobody yet stayed pregnant forever and being calm will help you and your body to go through this.
Sometimes it's so hard to relax when you don't know what to expect and you still have a lot of questions. Luckily enough NHS provides antenatal classes that are designed to answer on most of your questions and help you to feel more confident and prepared.
Usually, these classes are running close to the place where you are thinking to give birth. You can use this opportunity to check the place where everything is happening. You would also be able to meet other mums and possibly find some new friends.<br/>


I hope this checklist will help you to prepare for your big day.
