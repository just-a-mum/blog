Having a baby is an amazing experience, but is this something you are financially prepared for? Having a baby will increase your spend on a few thousand a year. A lot of couples are thinking about how can they support the baby with the income they have.

To be honest, babies don't need much for the first few years and with a little bit of budgeting and research, you can save quite a bit.

##### 1. Check the benefits

Look on the government site if you can clime any benefits like tax-free childcare and if you are eligible for maternity pay.

Check with your company to see if they have an extended maternity pay. Be careful and read all the conditions for receiving extended maternity pay. A lot of companies require you to come back to work for at least half a year, otherwise, you would need to return that money back.

It is also worth looking into the Shared Parental Leave schema and maybe your partner's company also provides some benefits as fully paid shared parental leave for a few weeks or extra discounts for the baby products.

##### 2. Sign up for bonus cards and free products

It's worth signing up for the Boots Advantage Cards as it gives you a lot of points that you can spend towards other products.

There are also sites like Emma diary and Bounty that provide you several bags with baby products for free. You can usually pick up these bags in Argos or Boots.

##### 3. Think twice before buying baby products

I know that you want all the best for your baby and there are so many baby products on the market. The reality is that you don't need most of there products.
The most important for babies in the first year is to be as close as possible to the mum.

I created a list of essential items for the baby in the other post: <a href="/blog/newborn-essentials/">What to Buy When You Expect a Baby</a>

##### 4. Use second-hand items

There is nothing wrong in going to Facebook Market and get some-second hand toys, crib, buggy, cloth. Babies are growing very fast and most likely all these second-hand items were used only for a couple of months and are all in great condition. Some of the items might still be new.
This way you can save quite a bit of money.

##### 5. Use cloth nappies and save the planet

Just imagine that you would need to use nappies for the next 2-3 years or even more. On average your use 3-4 nappies a day. It is in total it's more than 4000 nappies per baby that go to the fields.
You can save quite a bit if you decide to use cloth nappies and it's better for the planet. If dealing with cleaning these nappies is not pushing you back then it's worth trying it.

##### 6. Borrow toys

Usually, kids are so excited to see new toys and you expect them to enjoy them for quite a while. Unfortunately, they lose interest very quickly. In a couple of days, you will notice that these toys are just staying somewhere in the corner or under the sofa and your child doesn't even come to it anymore.
If you want to keep your flat cleaner and save some money you can check if your library has an option to borrow some toys and books for kids. You might also find some companies around that let you borrow toys for a few weeks for a small subscription fee.
