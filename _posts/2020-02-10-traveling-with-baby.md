Traveling is exciting and a lot of fun. It's a great way to see new places, to learn about new cultures and try new things. Though traveling with a baby is completely different from traveling alone and not for everyone.
Don't take me wrong, it's still a lot of fun, but much more challenging, unexpected and stressful. This is something that should be planned in advance and very well thought through to make sure that everyone enjoys the trip.
If you are an easy-going person and can deal with unexpected situations than it worth doing this. At the end of the day, babies don't care where they go as long as they are close to their mums and dads.

I covered below different situations I had to deal with during our trips with two babies and included some suggestions.

##### 1. Wait until your baby is at least 3 months

Regardless on how much you love traveling it's better to wait for at least months. This should be enough time for your baby to improve the immune system, for the mum to recover after the labour and pregnancy and get familiar with baby needs.


##### 2. Baby travel documents

Your baby needs a passport and a travel visa, so make sure to get all the necessary documents. You also need to carry a birth certificate with you in case it's needed as this is proof that the baby is yours.
Once I forgot to take it and it was much harder to pass the border.

##### 3. Travel light

If you think that you need to pack a lot of things for your little one then you are wrong. Your baby needs only some essentials, but there is no need to take too many cloth or toys you will never use. Remember that you can always wash your cloth and buy some basic things on the way.
For me, the simple rule was not to take more than I can fit into the hand luggage. So generally speaking I would take only one piece of  hand luggage and a backpack per adult. This way you are very mobile and can concentrate on your baby and less worry about your items.
It also would be much easier to get the train and move between locations. In the next post, I will provide the list of baby items I pack with us.

##### 4. Use baby carrier if you can or a compact stroller

It is so much easier just to have your baby on you rather than worrying about the buggy. If your baby is already too big for the baby carrier than a compact stroller that can fold into a hand luggage size will work as well.
When I had my first trip to Europe I took the buggy instead of the baby carrier and I did regret it a lot as it reduced our mobility.
The inconvenience of having a buggy:
- you cannot always have your buggy next to the plane once you arrive at the destination and need to carry your baby in hands for quite a while until you reach the luggage arrival point
- not every bus will have a space for the buggy
- it doesn't always fit a taxi
- the roads are not always good at your final destination or maybe there won't be any roads
- it's much harder to use stairs

If you cannot avoid taking the buggy with you then consider buying a very portable and light one like YoYo.

##### 5. Travel insurance

I know that you don't always buy travel insurance especially if you don't go far. When you travel with a small baby there is a higher chance of unexpected things happening and baby can get sick very easily, so consider getting one as it can help you a lot. Also make sure you know where to find a doctor if you need one.

##### 6. Feeding your baby

You are in luck if you are breastfeeding as you always have warm milk ready for your little one and you don't need to bring extra things in your luggage. Don't worry too much if you need to breastfeed in public place. Believe me, most of the people don't pay any attention to it and fine about someone feeding the baby in public places. To feel more comfortable consider using the special breastfeeding cloth. I had to breastfeed in the buses and trains and no one even looked at me.
If you feed the baby from the bottle take something that will keep the milk warm for as long as possible. There are not always places around where you can heat up the milk, though most of the coffee shops will help you to heat up the milk.

##### 7. Changing nappy

When you need to change your baby there are usually a lot of changing rooms around. If there are no changing rooms then just use your changing mat and change your little one where you can. Though bear in mind that no one around wants to smell the poop of your baby, so choose the corner with fewer people.

##### 8. Security check at the airport

There are security checks at the airport that can be a stressful experience if you are traveling with a baby. Once you are there you would need to unpack tablets, laptops, liquids and put separately on the belt from all the rest of the luggage. Don't forget that you need to fold and put your buggy on the belt as well.  Pack smart at home and make sure that it would be easy to take all these things out of the luggage.  By the way, when you are traveling with a baby there are no restrictions on how much consumable liquids you can take.

Some airports have a separate security check for families and it can be quite handy as there are fewer people, more space and people to help. Then just relax, take your time and others can wait.

##### 9. Plane

There is an advantage to have a baby with you if you want to be one of the first people to get into the plane as most of the airlines give a priority boarding for people with small kids.
Also, some airplanes have seats with bassinet in the plane. It can be hard to book them, but you can try to call the airline and try to book it. If not find the seats with more room for the legs as the more space you have the better.

##### 10. Car seat

It is a pain to carry a car seat with you as it takes so much space.  Most of the rental companies can provide you a child seat. If you are using a taxi you can also ask for the child seat if you book in advance.
If you travel by public transport then you don't need to have one.

##### 11. Toys

I was surprised, but toys take so much space and they are not used most of the time. I would suggest taking only 2 toys that your kid likes the most. You don't need more as you can make anything to be a toy. As a backup option install some baby-friendly apps on your mobile that can work without wifi.

##### 12. Travel plan

If you are alone you can see a lot during the day and can ever do a city per day. It's completely different when you have a baby. Consider choosing one or maximum locations to visit in one trip and just settle down there and explore it slowly. This way you can enjoy your trip more and avoid some unnecessary stress.

##### 13. Accommodation

It's much easier to stay in the apartment than in the hotel. You would need at least a basic kitchen to be able to prepare food for your baby.
Also, ask for a cot bed. Most of the places have it available on request.


I hope this will help you to get ready for your first trip with your baby.
