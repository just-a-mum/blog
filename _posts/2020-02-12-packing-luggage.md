At first, it might seem that your baby needs a lot of things on the trip, but don't be fulled. Don't pack everything as babies don't need much, pack only items you are sure you would need in your trip. I usually travel only with one hand luggage and a backpack per adult even if we go away for a month. Most of the airlines allow to have a piece of extra hand luggage for a baby but do check it before going on a trip.

All the items I would need in the plane and at the airport I put into the backpack. All the rest goes into my main hand luggage. Below I provided the list of items I usually take with me when I go on the trip with my kids.

##### Main luggage:
- my cloth that is suitable for breastfeeding
- about 5-7 baby outfits (you can always wash it later on)
- at least one warm outfit
- blanket or sleeping bag to sleep in or a comfy and warm full body sleeping suit
- diapers and wipes for 3 days: you can buy more diapers later
- baby sun cream if you are going to the seaside

##### Backpack:
- laptop
- baby food and snacks: there are no restrictions on how much baby food or liquids you can take with you
- paracetamol for babies
- disinfecting wipes
- baby wipes
- sudo cream
- diapers
- snacks and baby food - consider taking at least one bottle of milk with you
- extra set of cloth for baby: accidents happen and you need to be prepared for it
- something comfortable and warm for baby to sleep in (I used a warm full body suit)
- a couple of pacifiers
- travel changing mat
- a bag to put your dirty things and rubbish
- 1 or 2 toys
- other liquids that I need to show during the security check at the airport (they can be packed away once you passed the security check)

##### Additional items
- baby carrier or stroller

##### Things you can live without
- breast pump: seriously, you can express milk without having a pump, it's not that hard
- baby shoes: if your baby doesn't walk then you don't need them
- too many toys: on the trip, anything can be a toy, so no need to bring many toys with you


I would suggest to pack all baby items first and then use all the remaining space for your items.
