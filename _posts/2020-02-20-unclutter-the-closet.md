Most of us have a lot of unused clothes in the wardrobe. It creates an untidy look and it's hard to find anything. Most likely you don't even use 40 % of your items anymore and make you feel that you have clothes but you don't have anything to wear. For me, it's very frustrating spending too much time trying to find the item or a combination of clothes I'm happy to wear.

It's a good practice to revise your clothes and clean your closet at least once. I usually find a free rainy day on the weekend when I can just spend enough time to sort everything out.

How to start clearing your closet?

##### 1. Find time
Make sure that you have at least 3-4 hours that you can spend for sorting out your clothes and no one will destruct you.

##### 2. Take everything out
Take everything you have in your wardrobe out and put it on the bed. Take out all shoes and even accessories as it's good to know what you have and you might even find things you forgot about a long time ago.

##### 3. Clean the closet
It's a quick step, but very important. Wipe off the dust from all your shelves and don't forget to clean under and behind the wardrobe.

##### 4. Sorting
Create 4 piles:
- (yes): still using
- (maybe): I love it, but not using
- (no) I don't use it and will never use it
- (what is that?): everything that shouldn't be here
- (trash): all rubbish to throw away

Take each item from the bed and decide which pile it belongs to. If you didn't wear anything for 3 years then it's very unlikely that you will wear it again.

##### 5. Decide on storage
Think about how you will store your clothes and how many hangers you might need. Check if you have enough space and rearrange shelves if needed. If you have time you can also create a digital version of your wardrobe on your tablet or phone.

##### 6. Put clothes in the wardrobe
Create a system in the wardrobe to make it easy to find everything you need to create your perfect outfit within seconds.
Take items one by one from the 'yes' pile and find a place for it in the closet. Make a photo of each item before putting it into the wardrobe.
Once you are done with 'yes' pile, find some box big enough to fit all items from the 'maybe' pile. Make a photo of each item from the 'maybe' pile and pack the box away. If you won't need anything from that box for the next year, then you can give that cloth away.

##### 7. What to do with other clothes
There are several ways to deal with the clothes you don't need anymore.
- If you have time and creativity think about how you can use this cloth. Maybe you can make a new top, bag, rug or accessory from some of the items.
- Donate the clothes that are still in good condition
- Throw all the rest together with rubbish


Your closet should look now clean, tidy and organized. I hope you enjoyed the process and freed up some space for new cloth.
