It's never too early to pack the labour bag as you never know when the little one decides that it's the time to come to our world. But wait, what should you have in this bag?

If you have a chance visit the place where you are planing to give birth and find out what is available there. Check if there are places where you can buy food, snacks or coffee.

Usually you stay in the hospital 1-2 nights, so you don't need to pack too much with you. I found it quite useful to have 2 bags: one is for me and another one is for baby.
I created a list of of items what should be in the hospital bag based on my experience.

<h4> What Should Be in Your Bag</h4>

Try to avoid taking too much. All your items should fit into a backpack or a small hand luggage bag.
When you are packing split all your items in two groups: the ones that you need before the delivery and the ones you will use after. This way it would be easier for you to reach quickly everything you need when you are in the hospital or birthing center. (You won't have a lot of space in the hospital to take everything out of your bags)

<h5>Before delivery:</h5>

 - **pregnancy notes**: to be honest you should always have your notes with you when you live the house

- **medication** that you are taking

- **contact lenses** or **glasses** if you use them

- **bag with toiletries** that has at least toothbrush, toothpaste, hair band, hairbrush, shampoo

- **comfortable cloth**: it should be quite loose and you will use it to walk around the hospital before the delivery of your baby (knee length loose dress was my choice)

- **charger** for the phone: most likely you will be in the hospital longer than a day and you would need to charge your phone

- **snacks** in case the food store is closed

- **cash** if you want to buy something in the vending machine

- **TENs machine (optional)** if you would like to use it during your labour. DOn't forget to take batteries for it.

- **scented oil (optional)** for the hypnobirth

- **pillow (optional)**: usually hospitals have enough pillows, but if you have the one that you can't live without then you can take it with you

- **ear plugs (optional)**: this can be useful to prevent the noise from other patients

- **entertainment (optional)** like books or tablet, though usually having phone is enough

<h5>After the delivery</h5>

- **underpants**: take at least 5 pairs or consider using disposable ones

- **more comfortable cloth** to wear after the delivery and to sleep in if you are staying overnight. If you are breastfeeding take with you nursery top and something that is easy to open in front.

- **towel** to take a shower after the delivery

- **maternity pads**: take a least two packs as one might not be enough

- **slippers** to walk around

- **extra cloth to go back home**. It is possible that the cloth you arrived in is still clean, but better to be safe

- **photo camera** to make amazing photos of your little one

- **compression socks**

I would also suggest to take an empty bag to pack away your dirty cloth, so you can easily put it out of the way.


<h4>What Should Be in the Bag for Your Baby Bag</h4>

- **nappies**: take at least a pack of 20 nappies. You would need to change your little one quite a lot.

- **vests and all-in-one suits**: take a couple of them as your baby can get cold very easily

- **a hat**: take a couple of them of different sizes

- **socks** to keep the feet warm

- **baby wipes or cotton wool pads** which are gentle enough to your baby skeen

- **snowsuit** to go back home if it is cold outside

- **baby chair** if you have a car and you are planing to drive back

- **cream for the ass** in case your baby has a nappy rush(something like sudo cream will work)

- **blankets(optional)** to cover the baby, but usually hospitals provide them

- **scratch mittens** to cover baby hands

<h4>What Should Be in Your Partner's Bag</h4>
If your partner is planing to stay with you all the time he also needs to take a few things with him.

- **contact lenses** or **glasses** if he uses them

- **bag with toiletries** that has at least toothbrush, toothpaste, deodorant

- **charger** for the phone

- **snacks** in case the food store is closed

- **cash** for the vending machine

- **extra cloth** to change if needed

These lists should cover everything you need for yourself, your baby and your partner while you are in the hospital. Now it's time to relax and wait for your Big Day.
